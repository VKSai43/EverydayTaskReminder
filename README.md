# Everday ToDOList

This web based app is used for making a ToDOList and list of tasks for each of the ToDOList.

It can be your ToDOList for planning a raod trip, a ToDOList for organising a social event and many more day-to-day activities.

You can toggle the individual tasks as completed/todo or can toggle the whole ToDOList as done/to-do.
